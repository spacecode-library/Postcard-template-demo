# Production Issues Found During Final Review

## Critical Layout Issues

### 1. Onboarding Step 1 Layout ❌
**Issues Found:**
- Back button is too wide (should be just "← Back" text, not a button)
- Continue button placement is wrong (directly under form instead of footer)
- Footer section missing fixed positioning at bottom
- Step indicator ("Step 1 of 6") not shown with Continue button
- Form spacing too tight

**Required Fixes:**
- Make back button text-only with arrow
- Move Continue button to fixed footer
- Add "Step 1 of 6" text to left of Continue button
- Add footer text "Please fill the form first, before continuing to the next step"
- Increase form field spacing

### 2. Create Campaign Layout Reference
**Observations from CreateNewCampaign designs:**
- Single centered form field per step
- Fixed footer with:
  - Helper text centered
  - Step indicator on left
  - Continue button on right
- Much more spacious layout
- Back button is minimal text style

### 3. Button Consistency Issues ❌
**Current Issues:**
- Continue buttons have inconsistent placement across screens
- Back buttons styled as full buttons instead of text links
- Button sizes vary between screens

### 4. Spacing Inconsistencies ❌
**Issues:**
- Form fields too close together
- Section padding varies between screens
- Card spacing in dashboard needs adjustment

### 5. Typography Issues ❌
**Need to verify:**
- Heading sizes and weights
- Form label weights (should be 600)
- Body text colors (#6B7280 vs #9CA3AF)

### 6. Component Alignment ❌
**Issues:**
- Footer buttons not properly aligned
- Form elements not centered in some screens
- Inconsistent margins

## Screen-by-Screen Issues

### Login Screen ✅
- Mostly correct
- Verify password dots display
- Check "Remember for 30 days" checkbox styling

### SignUp Screen ✅
- Layout matches design
- Helper text properly styled

### Dashboard ✅
- Empty state correct
- Filled state matches design
- Period filters properly styled

### History Screen ✅
- Table columns already updated
- Matches new design requirements

### Onboarding Steps 1-6 ❌
- Step 1: Major layout issues (see above)
- Step 2-6: Need to verify footer consistency
- All steps should use fixed footer layout

### Create Campaign Steps 1-6 ❌
- Need to match single-field centered layout
- Fixed footer implementation required
- Verify all 6 steps

### Settings ❓
- Need to review all tabs
- Verify form layouts

## Priority Fixes

1. **Fix Onboarding/Create Campaign footer layout** - ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Footer now fixed at bottom
   - Still need to update footer text for each step
   
2. **Standardize button styles** - ❌ NEEDS WORK
   - Back button needs to be text-only
   - Continue button styling is correct
   
3. **Fix form spacing** - ❌ NEEDS UPDATE
   - Form groups need larger margins (2rem)
   - Overall layout needs more breathing room
   
4. **Verify all typography** - ❌ NEEDS REVIEW
   - Form labels should be font-weight: 600
   - Check all heading sizes
   
5. **Test all screen states** - ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE
   - Empty states working
   - Filled states working
   - Need to verify error states
