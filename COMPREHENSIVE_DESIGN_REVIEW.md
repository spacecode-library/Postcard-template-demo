# Comprehensive Frontend Design Review

## Design Image Mapping Clarification:
- Onboarding(1) images = Step 2 (Template Selection)
- Onboarding(2) images = Step 2 variations
- Onboarding(3) = Step 3 (Postcard Editor)
- Onboarding(4) = Step 4 (Targeting & Budget)
- Onboarding(5) = Step 5 (Payment)
- Onboarding(6) = Step 6 (Launch)

## Critical Issues Found:

### 1. Onboarding Sidebar
**Issue**: Step text is too large and gets cut off
**Fix Applied**: Reduced font sizes to 0.8125rem for titles, 0.6875rem for subtitles
**Status**: âœ“ Fixed

### 2. Template Selection (Step 2)
**Design vs Implementation**:
- Selected state: Design shows green (#079455), implementation had teal
- "Customize" button: Should change to "Selected" when active
- Template card hover states need verification
- Product Details dropdown animation timing

### 3. Missing Design for Step 1
**Issue**: No design image found for "URL Business" step
**Current Implementation**: Form collecting name, email, business info
**Risk**: May not match intended design

### 4. CSS Bleeding Issues Found:
```css
/* Problem: Generic selectors affecting global scope */
.form-input:invalid:not(:placeholder-shown):not(:focus) {
  border-color: #EF4444;
}

/* Problem: Overly specific pseudo-selectors */
.step-item:last-of-type {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

/* Problem: Unscoped animations */
@keyframes spin {
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

### 5. Component Modularity Issues:

**Not Properly Modularized**:
- Form validation logic scattered across components
- No shared form field components
- Password field component needed for consistency
- Template card selection logic duplicated

**Good Modularity**:
- AuthLayout properly extracted
- Logo component reusable
- Sidebar component well isolated

### 6. Responsive Design Issues:
- Mobile sidebar grid layout may break on very small screens
- Form fields don't stack properly on mobile
- Template cards need better mobile layout
- Footer buttons overlap on small screens

### 7. Color Inconsistencies:
- Primary green: #20B2AA (teal) vs #079455 (green)
- Gray shades not consistently applied
- Button hover states vary between components

### 8. Missing Loading States:
- No skeleton loaders for template loading
- No loading indicators for form submission
- No error states for failed API calls

## Recommendations:

1. **Create Shared Components**:
   - FormField component with validation
   - PasswordField with visibility toggle
   - LoadingState component
   - ErrorBoundary for each major section

2. **Fix CSS Scoping**:
   - Use CSS modules or styled-components
   - Prefix all animations with component name
   - Avoid global pseudo-selectors

3. **Standardize Design Tokens**:
   - Create single source of truth for colors
   - Define spacing scale and use consistently
   - Typography scale needs enforcement

4. **API Integration Preparation**:
   - Add loading states to all async operations
   - Create error handling components
   - Add retry logic for failed requests
   - Implement proper form validation with API errors

5. **Mobile-First Refactor**:
   - Start with mobile design and enhance
   - Use container queries where supported
   - Test on actual devices, not just browser tools
