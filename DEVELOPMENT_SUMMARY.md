## Environment Configuration
The `.env` file is configured with:
- `VITE_API_URL`: Production API endpoint
- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth client ID

## Build Status
✅ **Build successful** - The application builds without errors and is ready for deployment.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Add error boundaries for better error handling
3. Implement more detailed analytics visualizations
4. Add real-time updates using WebSockets
5. Implement A/B testing for templates
6. Add more comprehensive testing

## Notes
- The application uses a Node.js version warning during build (21.2.0), but builds successfully
- All API endpoints are integrated but some features depend on backend data availability
- Google Sign-In is fully configured and working
- The design follows a consistent, professional style throughout
