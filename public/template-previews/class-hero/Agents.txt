hey i want you to work on making sure we complete this system quick and make sure it's working correctly keep in mind the database we are using is alive railway database therefore all changes to the database should follow this hack {AI production test hacks
  1. If you want to perform database fixes to a database in production like railway then you can
  write a script that can be run from an endpoint then push it to railway and call that endpoint to perform fixes then revert the changes and  push the clean code with the updates reflected to the main sql file  }, 
anywaym heard you have a subagent feature and i want you to help me create subagencts and then to used these agents to help make significant progress to this system and to make sure it functional i want you to save important information of what i will give you to help you down the road of the development process the current system works okay but i used alot of AI to vibe code it without alot of knowledge of the flow the client wanted of this system what i want you to is perform a review of the current code base frontend, backend, database and to understand what key features are there and the agent we will make to help make sure the development process is successful keep in mind these are the main roles you will be working with also keep in mind that the staff accounts use a 2FA system so you should ask for the new 2FA code if you want to test at any point but keep in mind that you have to review how to login and you can save the token to use later instead of loggin in again keep in mind you have to be fast when loggining in when i provide you with the 2fa code because it expires in 15 seconds 
const testUsers = {
    admin: {
      email: process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL || 'banturide5@gmail.com',
      password: process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD || 'Milan18$',
      twoFactorCode: process.argv[2] || '016221' // Pass as first argument
    },
    therapist: {
      email: process.env.THERAPIST_EMAIL || 'codelibrary21@gmail.com',
      password: process.env.THERAPIST_PASSWORD || 'Milan18$',
      twoFactorCode: process.argv[3] || '335952' // Pass as second argument
    },
    client: {
      email: process.env.CLIENT_EMAIL || 'mukelathegreat@gmail.com',
      password: process.env.CLIENT_PASSWORD || 'Milan18$'
    }
  }; 
So the booking process should have the location as the first option this means the user needs to select their location first then they can select a time etc but if they select a therapist they should be asked to select a time again based on the availabile times of that therapist, I also want you to keep in mind that these are the locations: GOB Praktijken - Psychologen- en therapeutenpraktijk

 I want you to keep in mind that the appointment document examples you see above is their old system’s method of taking appointments but we are going to make it better and improve it the current appointment method we have is good but we want to improve it to be better to use:
  But we have to make sure that the location is saved keep in mind that the location will also be needed when pairing a client with a therapist this means you will have to review how you are going to implement this make sure to call the inspect schema to better understand the database : https://praktijk-epd-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/schema/inspect-schema           once you have performed a curl command call to get an understanding of the database and example of data from each table and the data that is used and the ones that is not used and compare it with the backend and frontend to make sure you know what’s being used and what’s not I want you to use the aspect schema to know what the database looks and make sure to save it to /Users/mukelakatungu/praktijk-epd-backend/schema-analysis.json and other file to save some sample data from the database, you will use this information to make sure that the booking requests and the auto matching system works correctly and to make sure that location is saved and to make sure these details reflect on the frontend keep in mind the flow of the booking process is that when the user sends an appointment request if they haven’t selected a therapist and selected to be auto matched with the best therapist of their need then the auto match will match them with someone only if the admin has auto match active if it’s not toggled on then the system won’t match them up keep in mind this process will happen immediately if the admin has auto match active and enabled, if a therapist has been selected based on their availability then they are booked and the time is removed from the database and no one else can book an appointment at that same time as the previous client. If the auto match toggle is off then the admin will assign a therapist to the client but the AI auto match will provide suggestions based on the problems the client is facing the location preferring therapist in the user’s area. I want you to also keep in mind that the admin should be able to see all details about the appointment. Also keep in mind that based the type of therapy and the duration it should show the therapist and also please review the therapist frontend and backend to make sure they are able to see a notification when a client has been assigned to them on the dashboard and a red dot next to the client tab on the sidebar, I want you to also make sure that they are able to see full details about the appointment and able to see the client’s profile I want you to also make sure that when they start the sessions for that particular appointment the session is the same duration as the duration the particular appointment is supposed to be btw I want you to keep in mind that every appointment has a duration make sure to review the type of appointment I also want you to keep in mind that later we want the admin to be able to adjust the duration of certain appointments but for now you can just make sure that what we design makes sure it will be easy to add that feature in the future. 
Therapists will be able to see their appointments and start sessions with clients and be able to track the session within the web app you can review the current session implementation. 




Messaging:


The messaging function doesn’t work correctly right now and I don’t think th current messaging implementation is ideal can you please make a subagent that will be focused on working on the messaging system for this system it should have access to https://praktijk-epd-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/schema/inspect-schema which is the live database the backend code which you are currently in and the frontend code which is at mukelakatungu@Mukelas-MacBook-Air praktijk-epd-frontend-1 %  /Users/mukelakatungu/praktijk-epd-frontend-1 once the subagent has done this it should think of an efficient and more effective messaging system that will allow clients to text their therapists and for therapists to text the clients I also want you to make sure that the therapist can text the admin too and other users the client can only text their therapist while the staff members can text each other, I want you to make sure the messaging system works correctly all the time and make sure their no errors




UI AND FRONTEND:


This is an enterprise app that will be comprehensive I want you to make sure that we don’t use any modals everything should be inline and make sure that we are using the frontend’s notification system that allows the users to be notified when operations have been performed so they can know if their operation was successful or not I also want you to make sure that the frontend is well organized and intuitive and make sure that the filters all work correctly and make sure that it shows all necessary data and details in a well organized, clean and Clear make sure that the UI follows the theme of the web app is profession with no emojis but uses professional icons and performs operations all correctly. Make sure that the translation function works correctly for the whole system making sure that the text can be converted for English to dutch and vis-visa.
