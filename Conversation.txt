you can begin and send loom videos with questions and I will answer async


Marty
  10:40 PM
Please lay out a timeline for development efforts as well. Thank you!


Marty
  4:52 PM
I will be expecting daily updates and a summary of what was worked on along with any questions, please provide today’s update and the video for setting up google


Mukela Katungu
  5:23 PM
It will take 3 weeks till we have a production ready system with 3 revisions
5:23
So once we have made significant progress we will setup a meeting to discuss what we have done (edited) 
5:24
Done and what changes you would want


Marty
  5:24 PM
Okay, what happened to the initial week timeline? That is still okay
5:24
Please send the google video


Mukela Katungu
  5:27 PM
A week might cause low quality work because the services might have there own roadblocks and breaks throughout the development process. We would recommend 3 weeks because it allows for more test time and platform confirmation


Marty
  5:28 PM
That’s fine


Mukela Katungu
  5:28 PM
@Rahul Kumar will send the loom video


Marty
  5:28 PM
Please send updates daily so I am in the loop
5:29
Just a quick summary of what was worked on so I can track progress and we can course correct if needed
5:31
It is very important to me that we have good communication, it helps us avoid a lot of delays
